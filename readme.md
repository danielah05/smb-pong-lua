# smb pong
a lua script for both mesen and fceux where you get forced to play pong perfectly while beating smb1

recommended:  
i highly recommend using the MESEN version of the lua script.  
i wrote the lua script originally for mesen and then ported it to fceux after.  
the fceux version could have some issues that i missed so i just recommend using the mesen version.
